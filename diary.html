Fruit and vegetables are a vital source of vitamins and minerals and should make up just over a third of the food we eat each day. It's advised that we eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day.

There's evidence that people who eat at least five portions a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

Eating five portions is not as hard as it sounds. Just one apple, banana, pear or similar-sized fruit is one portion (80g). A slice of pineapple or melon is one portion. Three heaped tablespoons of vegetables is another portion.

Having a sliced banana with your morning cereal is a quick way to get one portion. Swap your mid-morning biscuit for a tangerine, and add a side salad to your lunch. Have a portion of vegetables with dinner, and snack on fresh fruit with natural plain yoghurt in the evening to reach your five a day.
