					Black nuts poop is connected together but still rather lumpy is also a sign of constipation. The poop spent too much time drying in the intestines, but it has not dried out enough to break apart into small pieces.
					This form of poop often hurts the most when being passed since it is generally large and quite firm. In order for the stool to take this lumpy, sausage-shaped form, it needs to remain in the colon for a couple weeks instead of the regular 72 hours.`;

					You just ate something that didn't necessarily agree with your stomach, eat more vegetable and less fried food or fast food. Make sure drink more water and do more exercise

					Brown pee is on its way to becoming—or actually is—your old friend diarrhea. You can get diarrhea for a lot of reasons. Sometimes you just ate something that didn't necessarily agree with your stomach. Sometimes you might be really sick. This post can't tell you which it is, so talk to your doctor if you're concerned.

					The most typical reason for having white urine is simply being overly hydrated. If you drink too much water, the water fills up your bladder pretty quickly. When your bladder is full, you feel a need to pee, and you pee out mostly water. That is actually a slight positive because you do not want water and chemicals to sit in your bladder too long. If they do, the bacteria and toxins that your body is also trying to remove will have a chance to sit in your bladder, mix and multiply. The multiplying bacteria can cause urinary tract infections so you definitely want to empty your bladder of all that.
					<p class='infoTitle'>Suggestion</p>
					If you feel that you can not keep the healthiest diet and a most regular exercise regimen, one option is to take vitamins to give your body and your organs some help in staying healthy.
